# Com.covisint.messaging.documentsplit.X12GroupSplitter
This splitter can be used for splitting documents that contain different message sets within the same ISA and where translation is required.  This splitter should be used if you need accurate 997's to be generated.  This splitter will separate like transaction sets by the GS control number.  Although it is not standard to use different transaction sets within the same functional group, this splitter will handle it.  It will also handle multi ISA envelopes.  The behavior of this splitter is unpredictable if there is no ST, SE, GE, and/or IEA segments.
